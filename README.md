# My Pleco Data Analysis

I have been studying Mandarin Chinese since January 2017. In April 2017, I started using Pleco to do flashcards. I find this to be a really great way to practice vocabulary.

Pleco stores all of the flashcard results in a SQLite database and I always thought about how I could do some kind of analysis on this.
